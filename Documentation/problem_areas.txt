not really problems
    main.rs
        why:
            fairly well commented
            * could use some small work
    dispatch_builder.rs
        why:
            well commented
            only needs overview
    resources folder
        largely self explanatory
        will be covered in a larger project definition
    renderer
        not so much our work, its a library

        overview:
            we don't have any clear direction for progress stated
            its unclear what is actually happening in this test build
    other:
        dead code:
            what is relevant dead code and what is not
            what is actually dead

big things:
    what point is the current version at?
        this demo does things, what is it doing
    where is this going?
        there's todo's everywhere what are they working towards
    dead code:
        it appears there are several dead ends, player stuff
        several places where "what is this even doing" is commented
    overviews:
        many things make sense in context, context should be easier to get

todo:
    vector2, add comments
