# Roadmap

In order of development priority:

    1. Implement and flesh out some basic game systems
        1. Combat
        2. Economy: Buying and Selling of all resources 
    2. Refactor Code to use a different rendering library, TCOD is out of date and it is unlikely that development will restart.
    3. Repair deployment on non-functional operating systems
    4. Implement more in-depth game systems
        - Player affiliation with islands
        - Ai goals and player independent systems
